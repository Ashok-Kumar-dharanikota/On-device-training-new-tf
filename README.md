# On-Device Training with TensorFlow (New Approach)

This repository demonstrates the implementation of on-device training using TensorFlow, specifically the new approach. The project focuses on training a machine learning model to classify 10 classes of 10 digits (0-9) using user-captured image data. The app provides two modes: Inference, which conducts classification using the trained model, and Training, which allows users to contribute their own image data to improve the model.

This readme file provides an overview of the project, details on how on-device training is implemented using the new approach, requirements to set up the project, instructions for usage, and future scope.

## Features

1. **On-Device Training**: The app enables on-device training of a machine learning model. Users can contribute their own image data to train the model, eliminating the need for data transfer to a remote server.

2. **Inference**: The trained model can be used for inference to classify digits in real-time. Users can capture or upload an image containing a handwritten digit, and the model will predict the digit accurately.

3. **Training Mode**: Users can switch to the Training mode and provide their own image data to improve the model's accuracy. This feature allows for user participation in model training and encourages continual improvement.

## Implementation Details

The on-device training using the new approach is implemented as follows:

1. The app utilizes TensorFlow's machine learning framework to define and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model from scratch.

2. The model architecture consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers and a softmax output layer with 10 classes for digit classification.

3. Users can capture or upload images containing handwritten digits and provide corresponding labels during the Training mode. The collected data is used to fine-tune the model weights.

4. The model is trained on the device using the collected data, and the weights are updated accordingly to improve classification accuracy.

5. In the Inference mode, users can capture or upload an image containing a digit, and the trained model performs real-time classification, predicting the digit.

6. The model training weights are not saved locally or within the application to preserve user privacy and prevent unauthorized access.

## Requirements

To set up and run this project, you need the following:

- Android Studio (version X.X.X or higher): The integrated development environment (IDE) for Android app development.
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have Java installed on your machine.
- An Android device or emulator: To run the app and test its functionality.
- TensorFlow: The TensorFlow library is required for machine learning model development and training.
- Android Camera Permissions: The app requires access to the device camera to capture images.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone [https://github.com/Ashok-Kumar-dharanikota/on-device-training.git](https://github.com/Ashok-Kumar-dharanikota/On-device-training-new-tf.git)


2. Open Android Studio and select "Open an existing Android Studio project."

3. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory and select the project.

4. Connect your Android device to your machine or set up an emulator.

5. Ensure that your device/emulator has developer options and USB debugging enabled.

6. Build and run the project on your device/emulator.

## Usage

Once the project is set up and running, you can use the app as follows:

1. Launch the app on your device/emulator.

2. Select the desired mode: Inference or Training.

3. In Inference mode, capture or upload an image containing a handwritten digit. The app will use the trained model to predict the digit.

4. In Training mode, capture or upload an image containing a handwritten digit, and provide the correct label for the digit. The app will collect and use this data to improve the model's accuracy. Repeat the process in Training mode to provide additional image data and labels for better training. Switch back to Inference mode to observe the improved accuracy of digit classification

## Future Scope
The future enhancements for this project include:

Implementing transfer learning techniques to improve the training efficiency and reduce the need for large amounts of user data.
Adding data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity and size of the training dataset.
Implementing privacy-preserving techniques, such as federated learning, to train the model collaboratively across multiple devices while protecting user data.
Integrating an active learning approach to intelligently select the most informative samples from user-contributed data for training.
